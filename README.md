    - 7.1: Cytron vacuum
    > control **DC Brushed Motor** using *Cytron*
    >
    > Implementing software soft start filter using Exponential smoothing filter
    >
    > Suitability of DC Motor for cleaning and wasre collection

    - 7.2: Magic of PID
    > Implementaion of PID that makes suction mechanism clean at rate 90 CFM (cubic feet per meter)
    >
    > Implementationof class for PID

    - 7.3: Hero of Mobility
    > Drive **Kinematic Model**
    >
    > Creation of Python Simulation of the movement of the robot
- Task 8: Now I Can See You
    - 8.1: Classical View
    > Implementing a classical algorithm using *OpenCV* that detects the balls in the images

    - 8.2: Visual Depth Estimate
    > Article about different methods to estimate depth from cameras and get 3D view of the world using different approaches and cameras
    >
    > Implementing Block match using python
    >
    > Explanation of the question and the distances

    - 8.3: You Only Look Once
    > Creating Object detection model using (using YOLOv8 ultralytics framework) that detect Egyptian coins
- Task 9: Fix EVE
    - 9.1: Altium Symphony
    > Design of **PCB** that includes:
    >
    > Microcontroller such as (Arduino Nano, STM32)
    >
    > Power inlet such as(power jack, rosetta)
    >
    > Interface with motor driver (L298N) and sensors such as (ultrasonic, IR, IMU) using base data or pin header
    >
    > Protection of the circuit from (inverse current, short circuit)
    >
    > Create SID to the system including PCB and Wiring
